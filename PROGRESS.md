### Decisions and v1 simplifications

**`block` policy is application-level retry, not transport-layer flow control.** Real production systems implement `block` at the transport layer — HTTP/2 flow control windows, gRPC's per-stream credits, Reactive Streams' demand signaling. Modeling that correctly is its own semester of work. v1 approximation: re-schedule the receive at `now + 50 × 2^attempt ms`, capped at 5 retries (≈ 1.5s max wait), then convert to capacity rejection. Documented at the call site. The lesson it teaches — `block` trades latency for fewer rejections — survives the simplification.

**`reject_oldest` on queues produces silent message loss.** The producer of the displaced message was already told `success: true` on enqueue; we don't retract that acknowledgment. This is realistic — production message queues (Kafka log retention, SQS, RabbitMQ default) behave this way under sustained overload. The dropped messages show up only in metrics, not in the producer's visible response. Comment in `queueBehavior.ts` explains the intent.

**0 = unbounded sentinel in the UI**, not `undefined`. With `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`, writing `undefined` through `Partial<T>` is a type error. Behaviors check `maxDepth !== undefined && maxDepth > 0` so existing v1 designs (where the field is genuinely absent) still mean unbounded. The UI uses `value ?? 0` for display and `Math.max(0, …)` on input.

**Database `rejection_policy` is `reject_newest` only in v1.** `reject_oldest` for a database has unclear semantics (would conflict with read ordering / transaction-isolation assumptions even in v1's read-only model).

**saturate_node emits synthetic `request_receive` directly at the target**, bypassing the upstream chain. The engine auto-creates a SimRequest from the receive (originNodeId = target, path = [target]). On completion, `forwardResponseUpstream` returns `[]` because the node is the origin — so the synthetic request leaves no orphan events past the chaos window.

**Backpressure-aware metrics**:
- `request_reject` events with `reason: 'capacity'` and `'capacity_displaced'` count toward the running `cumRejected` event tally and surface in the new dashed `reject/s` line on the error-rate chart.
- The error-rate chart became a `ComposedChart` with a second right-side y-axis so the rejection-rate line doesn't compete with the 0–100% error scale.
- `LoadBars` color-grades the fill bar with a deep-red pulsing animation when the queue is at cap AND rejecting in the current window.

### Re-reading appServerBehavior.onRequestReceive (per Prompt §12)

Traced by hand:

`queue_max_depth = 10`, queue currently has 9 ids, `processing = 5` (full).

- New request A arrives at `request_receive`. Branch 1: `processing >= capacity` → fall through. Branch 2: `q.length (9) < 10` → enqueue. depth = 10.
- New request B arrives at `request_receive`. Branch 1: still full. Branch 2: `q.length (10) < 10` → false. Branch 3: rejection_policy = reject_newest → emit `request_reject` + `request_response(success: false)` upstream via `rejectAndRespond`. Queue depth still 10.
- One request C completes. `request_complete` handler: `processing -= 1` (now 4). Forward response upstream. Shift one off queue (the request enqueued at the front). `startProcessing` increments processing back to 5. Queue depth now 9.
- New request D arrives. Branch 1: still full. Branch 2: `q.length (9) < 10` → enqueue. depth = 10.

The order is what the prompt called out: **decrement processing → drain → increment**. Net inFlight stays at capacity while the queue has work, which is the correct steady-state behavior. The "depth still 10 after one completion because drain raises it back to 10 immediately" observation in the prompt's §12 holds: between the decrement and the dequeue+startProcessing, depth is briefly 9, but no other event runs in that gap because behaviors are pure synchronous functions.

`npm run typecheck` → 0 errors

`npm run build` → main 910 kB / worker 32 kB (recharts adds ~400 kB; will lazy-load if it bites)

| 16 | typecheck / lint / build clean | ✅ |
| 17 | Build mode unchanged | ✅ |
| 18 | `?debug=sim` opens the 4a SimDebugPage | ✅ |

### Decisions and v1 simplifications

**Edge animations deferred.** The prompt explicitly listed edge animations as the first thing to cut if scope was tight. The rest of 4c was already at the limit; SimulationCanvas reserves the spot (LoadBars overlay is the same pattern animations would use) and the simStore tracks `inFlightRequests: Map<RequestId, InFlightRequest>` so the data is ready. Phase 6 polish.

**Network-partition side editor.** The form lets you see "side A: N nodes · side B: M nodes" but doesn't yet support multi-select of which nodes go where. The default split (first node alone vs. everyone else) is good for the common "client vs. backend" partition. Phase 6 adds the dual multi-select.

**`node_degraded` chaos** disabled with "Phase 6" tooltip per SPEC §7 v2.

**Speed control affects only delivery, not virtual time.** The engine produces the same event stream regardless of speed; `setSpeed(multiplier)` tunes `(yieldEvery, yieldDelayMs)` so the worker emits events to the main thread at the chosen wall-clock pace. Determinism preserved — verified by determinism test (7/7) and by acceptance criterion 4 (matching digests across speeds).

**Partition is intercepted at SCHEDULING time** (before request_send goes on the queue) per Prompt §10 + §14: a request crossing a partition boundary is replaced by a `request_reject('partition')` immediately, not delayed by network latency. Confirmed by re-reading `engine.ts: processEvent` — the partition check happens inside the behavior's NewEvent loop, before `scheduleEvent`.

**`request_receive` at a failed node is short-circuited at the engine level** to a `request_reject('failed')` — the behavior never sees the request. Cleaner than asking every behavior to check `isNodeDown(self.id)`.

**`cache_miss_storm` overrides are read by behaviors via `ctx.getCacheHitRateOverride(nodeId)`** rather than mutating params. Static params are immutable; chaos flows through context.

**Cumulative metrics line** in the metrics panel uses the running counters from 4b (`cumCompleted`, `cumFailedRequests`) plus event-counted `rejected` / `timed_out`. The arrived ≥ completed + failed invariant continues to hold.

**Worker is created fresh on every Run** (`terminate()` then `new SimWorker()`), so module-level state can't leak across runs and the determinism contract from 4b is preserved.

**v1 chaos timeline UI**: visual timeline with click-to-edit per-row forms. Drag-to-reposition is omitted; click a row, edit `at_ms` numerically. Phase 6 polish.

### Commits in this phase

1. `prompt-4c-deps` — recharts
2. `prompt-4c-schema-chaos-plan` — Design.chaosPlan + ChaosEventSpec.id
3. `prompt-4c-engine-pause-speed-chaos` — pause/resume/setSpeed + chaos.ts + engine state for failure/partition/cache-miss
4. `prompt-4c-sim-store` — useSimStore with stream state and caps
5. `prompt-4c-sim-ui` — SimulateMode + ControlPanel + SimulationCanvas + MetricsPanel + EventInspector + ChaosTimeline + LoadBars
6. `prompt-4c-app-integration` — SimulateMode default; `?debug=sim` escape hatch
7. `fix-4c-determinism-and-chart-click` — see "Follow-up" below

(The prompt's per-component commit chunking was collapsed at the UI step because the components are tightly coupled — every panel imports from `useSimStore` and a single broken store breaks the whole layout. Each panel is still cleanly separable in its own file.)

### Follow-up — chaos clamping, chart-click inspector wiring, timeline math

**Reported issues**:

1. With a `cache_miss_storm` whose `at_ms + duration_ms` exceeded the simulation duration, two seed=42 runs reportedly produced different digests in the browser despite identical metric counts.
2. Clicking the latency chart did not populate the Inspector.
3. The chaos timeline drew markers at visually-wrong positions.

**Investigation**:

Wrote a regression test (`src/sim/__tests__/determinism.test.ts`) that reproduces the user's exact scenario in Node: `cache_miss_storm` at `at_ms=2000, duration_ms=3500` against `client → cache → DB` at duration=5000. Three sequential seed=42 runs produce identical event arrays AND identical digests in Node. The engine itself is deterministic; the reported browser issue most likely stemmed from a stale worker bundle. Fixes were applied anyway because each is an independent correctness improvement.

**Fixes applied**:

1. **Chaos end-time clamping** (`src/sim/chaos.ts`): `compileChaosPlan` now takes `durationMs` and clamps every chaos end event to `min(at_ms + duration_ms, durationMs)`. Specs whose start is past `durationMs` are skipped entirely. Without clamping, the unfired end event sits on the queue at sim_end and leaves engine state (e.g. `cacheHitRateOverrides`) populated past the run's last fired event — a footgun for forensic comparisons. For `traffic_spike`, the clamped duration caps the count of pre-generated extra arrivals so no events are seeded past sim end.

2. **Chart click → Inspector** (`src/sim-ui/MetricsPanel.tsx`): the throughput, latency, and error-rate charts pass an `onClick` handler to Recharts. The handler reads `activeLabel` (the x-axis virtual time the user clicked nearest), then `pickInterestingEvent(events, t)` walks the event log backwards from the most recent event whose `at` falls in `[t-250ms, t+125ms)` and prefers a `request_response` / `request_timeout` / `request_reject` over any other kind. The picked event id is selected in the Inspector, which auto-renders its causal chain.

3. **Chaos timeline marker math** (`src/sim-ui/ChaosTimeline.tsx`): the timeline now uses an SVG `viewBox="0 0 durationMs 100"` with `preserveAspectRatio="none"`. Each marker draws at exactly its `at_ms` x-coordinate in viewBox space; horizontal stretch is handled by the browser. `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` keeps lines from thinning under stretch. Tick labels moved out of the SVG (where they'd stretch with the viewBox) into a separate DOM row of percentage-positioned divs so labels stay legible. The previous pixel-based math depended on `clientWidth` measurements that fired after first render, causing a brief mis-render on mount.

**Regression test result**: 8/8 tests pass, including the new `chaos plan with end-time past duration: 3 runs at seed=42 are identical` case.

## Phase 4b — Real Behavior Models for All 11 Component Types (complete)

`npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 (Simulate mode runs against real per-type behaviors)
`npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
`npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings
`npm run build` → main 488 kB / worker bundle **27 kB** (up from 12.5 in 4a — real behaviors)

### Dependencies added in Prompt 4b

None.

### Files

- New: `src/sim/routing.ts`, `src/sim/latency.ts`, `src/sim/behaviors/shared.ts`
- New: 11 behavior files in `src/sim/behaviors/` (one per ComponentType)
- Deleted: `src/sim/behaviors/echoBehavior.ts`
- Modified: `src/sim/engine.ts`, `src/sim/types.ts`, `src/sim/behaviors/types.ts`, `src/sim/worker.ts`

### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | echoBehavior.ts deleted; registry has 11 ComponentType keys, no 'echo' | ✅ |
| 2 | client → app_server → database chain; ~50 requests at 10 RPS over 5s | ✅ |
| 3 | Capacity matters: instances=1 × max_concurrent=5 at 200 RPS — queue grows, p99 climbs | ✅ |

| 5 | Round-robin distributes ~1/N to each backend over many requests | ✅ |
| 6 | failure_rate=0.5 → error_rate ≈ 0.5 ± noise | ✅ |
| 7 | retry_policy reduces error rate at the cost of higher p99 | ✅ |
| 8 | Same seed → identical determinism digest | ✅ |

| 11 | Build mode unchanged (no regressions in palette / inspector / annotations) | ✅ |
| 12 | typecheck / lint / build clean; zero new `as` casts in behavior bodies | ✅ |

### v1 simplifications (each behavior's "annotate this" notes consolidated)

These are stored in the schema and behaviors are written so they slot in cleanly when Phase 6 implements them — no schema or contract changes required:

| Component | What's simplified in v1 |
|---|---|
| client | params.timeout_ms not enforced separately; per-edge / per-target timeouts cover the common case. params.retry_policy unused — retries are an EDGE concept in v1. |
| load_balancer | max_connections and health_check_interval_ms stored, not enforced. No per-target health checking; failed targets get retried as if anyone could be next. |
| api_gateway | (no significant simplifications) |
| app_server | Queue is unbounded — no rejection on overflow. Phase 6 backpressure adds bounded queues + rejection policies via the existing Queue object boundary. |
| cache | capacity_items / eviction_policy stored, not enforced. hit_rate is a fixed probability — cache does not populate itself on the response path. |
| database | replicas / write_capacity_rps / write_latency_* / replication_mode / replication_lag_* / subtype stored, not used. All requests treated as reads (unless causalContext.kind === 'write', which no v1 behavior sets). read_capacity_rps used as a concurrent-in-flight cap (conflates rate with concurrency). |
| queue | visibility_timeout_ms / delivery_guarantee stored, not enforced. Consumer side is a simple downstream forward. |
| pub_sub | failure_rate is sampled at publish time only; per-subscriber delivery failures not modeled. If outgoing.length < subscriber_count, fan to all outgoing without failing. |
| cdn | (no significant simplifications beyond cache's) |
| object_storage | All requests treated as reads. Per-request size hardcoded to 1 KB (no schema field for byte size yet). |
| external_service | (no significant simplifications) |

### Decisions left to discretion in the prompt

**Reverse path strategy: Choice B — one hop at a time.** Each upstream node has a `request_response` handler that forwards to the previous hop on `request.path`. Composes better with future features (LB latency tracking, cache fill on response, circuit-breaker success registration) than emitting the full reverse chain eagerly.

**`queue_consumer_tick` added as a new SimEventKind.** Cleaner than overloading `request_dequeue` (which carries semantic meaning around request lifecycle). Tiny addition; documented in the kind union and the queue behavior's header.

**`inFlightByNodeId`: increment on `request_receive`, decrement on `request_send` / `request_complete` / `request_reject` / `request_timeout`.** Not on `request_dequeue` (that would double-count for app_server, which both receives and dequeues). The metric is approximate — counts queued + processing for capacity-bound nodes — but that's the right metric for least-connections routing (loaded backends should look more loaded).

**Persistent per-node rng** stored in `nodeState['__rng']`. Without this, `subStream` would produce a new closure each event dispatch and re-run the same sequence. Persistence makes log-normal latency samples actually distributed across requests.

**Engine auto-creates `SimRequest` records on `request_send` for unknown ids.** This is how queue ticks and pub/sub fanouts mint new request lifecycles without behaviors directly mutating the engine's request map.

**Engine OWNS path tracking** — appends to `request.path` on every `request_receive` at a new node. Behaviors don't manipulate path.

**Retries restricted to client and load_balancer** per Prompt 4b §5. Other behaviors forward failures upstream. Phase 6 can extend.

### Re-reading the engine and key behaviors (per Prompt §11)

Did so. Notes:

- `clientBehavior`: routing on arrival uses `defaultNextHop`. On response, finalization happens at the engine level (origin arrival drops the request from in-flight); the client behavior's only job on success is to clear the timeout guard. Failure path attempts a retry via `planRetry` against the same outgoing edge.
- `appServerBehavior`: when at capacity, requests go into `nodeState['queue']` (a `string[]` of request ids). `request_complete` decrements `processing`, emits `request_response`, and shifts the next queued id off to start processing. Drain happens lazily on each completion — no active "wake the queue" event needed.
- `queueBehavior`: producer's `request_response` is emitted INSIDE `onRequestReceive`, BEFORE the consumer-tick scheduling. So the producer's experienced latency is just the network latency (queue itself is "instant" from the producer's POV). The consumer tick is a self-targeted `queue_consumer_tick` event that fires later; it mints a NEW requestId and emits a normal `request_send` + `request_receive` pair across the first outgoing edge.
- `apiGatewayBehavior`: rate-limit and timeout-guard patterns make sense — each is contained in its own primitive (sliding window via array shift; timeout via shared.ts helpers). No surprises.

### Commits in this phase

1. `prompt-4b-engine-state-and-routing` — engine nodeState/inFlight, routing.ts, latency.ts, type updates
2. `prompt-4b-shared-helpers` — forward / reverse / timeout / retry primitives
3. `prompt-4b-eleven-behaviors-and-worker` — all 11 behaviors + worker import update + echo deletion
4. `fix-4b-completion-metrics-double-count` — see "Bug fix" below

(The Prompt 4b §10 ordering of one commit per behavior was collapsed to a single commit because each per-behavior commit would leave the worker importing a non-existent file or leave the engine without enough behaviors registered to simulate any design — the commits weren't independently functional. The combined commit's message walks through the behaviors in the suggested order.)

### Bug fix — completion metrics double-counted reverse-path hops

**Symptom**: `totalRequestsCompleted` ≈ 2× `totalRequestsArrived` for a `client → cache → database` design. Throughput chart read 20 RPS for a 10 RPS workload. Same shape on any chain with N≥2 hops.

**Root cause**: With Choice B reverse-path semantics (one hop at a time), each request emits **N `request_response` events** as it walks back through the chain. The engine's `buildSnapshot` was counting every `request_response` event in the log as a completion. The earlier heuristic — "filter to where the request was already finalized OR `payload.toNodeId === origin`" — fell apart once the request was deleted from `this.requests` (which happens at the FINAL response): all N reverse-path responses retroactively passed the filter.

**Fix**: the engine now tracks an explicit `finalResponseIds: Set<EventId>` populated in `maybeFinalize` exactly once per request — the moment the response arrives at `request.originNodeId`. Cumulative success/failure counts are running engine counters (`cumCompleted` / `cumFailedRequests`) bumped at the same point. Window metrics (throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate) all filter against this set; intermediate hops never participate.

Side benefits:
- `totalRequestsCompleted` and `totalRequestsFailed` are now per-request unique counts. The invariant `arrived ≥ completed + failed` holds at all times.
- Latency percentiles read the FINAL response's `durationMs` only, which is the full round-trip; intermediate hops' partial durations no longer skew the distribution.
- `totalRequestsRejected` and `totalRequestsTimedOut` are still event counts (a single request that retries 3× and times out each attempt would contribute 3 to `totalRequestsTimedOut`). Documented as informational in the engine.

**Re-verified after fix** (test cases from prompt):
- `client → cache → database` with `hit_rate=0.0` at 10 RPS / 5s → arrived ≈ completed ≈ 50, p99 includes DB latency.
- Same chain with `hit_rate=1.0` → arrived ≈ completed ≈ 50, p99 dramatically lower (cache hit short-circuits the path).

### Investigation — engine determinism (after the digest fix)

**Report**: three sequential seed=42 runs in the browser produced three different digests despite identical metric counts, even after the digest sort+id fix.

**Diagnostic step (per the user's prompt: "DO NOT GUESS")**: I built a Node-side test harness using vitest. It:

1. Constructs a fixture design with **fixed string ids** (no nanoid) so two test invocations see identical input.
2. Runs `SimulationEngine` directly in-process — no worker, no Comlink, no React.
3. Exercises the user's exact reproducer: `client → cache(hit_rate=0) → DB`, 5 s, 10 RPS, seed 42.
4. Calls `runOnce(seed=42)` THREE TIMES sequentially in the same Node process — sharing module state with the registry, behaviors, and any module-level closures the user's hypothesis menu pointed at.
5. Hashes each run with the same `computeDigest` the browser uses (extracted to `src/sim/digest.ts` so tests can call it).
6. Asserts deep-equality of event arrays AND digest equality across runs.
7. Adds a `structuredClone` roundtrip test to model the worker→main-thread serialization boundary.
8. Runs in both `pool: 'forks'` and `pool: 'threads'` to surface any cross-thread races.

**All seven tests pass, every time, including the user's exact reproducer.**

What this rules out:
- `Math.random()` / `Date.now()` / `performance.now()` / `crypto.getRandomValues` (none in `src/sim/` — verified by grep)
- Module-level mutable state in behavior files (none)
- Map/Set iteration order (no `Object.entries` / `[...map]` / `[...set]` in behavior code)
- PRNG state pollution at module load (no rng calls at module scope; behaviors only register handlers)
- Worker reuse across runs (`SimDebugPage` calls `terminate()` before `new SimWorker()`)
- Behavior-emitted events containing live mutable references (all payloads are fresh object literals with primitive values)
- structuredClone altering events (roundtrip test passes)
- Per-node rng lazy initialization (test confirms identical sequences)

**My honest read**: the engine is deterministic. The earlier fix (sort by `(at, id)` + include `id` in the digest key) addressed the actual digest-function bug. If the browser still shows different digests after that fix, the most likely explanation is a **stale worker bundle**. Vite's HMR for `?worker` modules is sometimes flaky — the browser holds onto an older worker bundle that still has the pre-fix digest function or pre-fix engine code. **Hard-refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R) AND **restart the dev server** (kill + `npm run dev`) to fully invalidate.

**Diagnostic added**: `SimDebugPage`'s `onComplete` now logs the first 10 + last 10 events in priority-queue order and stashes the full event list on `window.__lastEvents`. After a hard refresh + dev-server restart, run twice with seed=42 and compare:

```js
copy(JSON.stringify(window.__lastEvents))   // run 1
// (run again)
copy(JSON.stringify(window.__lastEvents))   // run 2 — diff against run 1
```

If they're identical → digest will match (the test suite already confirms this in Node).
If they differ → the diff is the smoking gun. The first divergent line tells us exactly what's breaking. Send it.

**Regression test**: `src/sim/__tests__/determinism.test.ts`, runs via `npm test`. Catches any future engine-side determinism regression.

### Bug fix — determinism digest drifted between identical runs

**Symptom**: Three runs with seed 42 / 5000 ms / 10 RPS / `client → cache(hit_rate=0) → DB` produced identical metrics (arrived 50, completed 50, p50 8.4 ms, p99 12.0 ms) but **three different digests**.

**Root cause**: the digest function in SimDebugPage.tsx iterated `allEventsRef.current` in **arrival order on the main thread** and **didn't include `id`** in the per-event key. The engine itself is deterministic — same seed + same config produce identical event ids in identical priority-queue order — but on the main thread, events arrive via Comlink-proxied callbacks. While `postMessage` is FIFO within one channel, the digest assumed something stronger and made no effort to sort. Two events scheduled at the same `at` could be reordered by any scheduling subtlety (callback microtask timing, React state updates interleaving with message handlers).

Hypothesis #3 from the report (worker reuses state) is **not** the cause: SimDebugPage already calls `workerRef.current?.terminate()` then `new SimWorker()` on every Run, so every run gets a fresh worker process with fresh module-level state.

**Fix**: `computeDigest` now (a) re-sorts events by `(at, id)` — the same tie-break the priority queue uses — and (b) includes `id` in the per-event key so same-`at` events with different ids contribute different bytes. The sort key is fully determined by the engine's deterministic scheduling order, not by main-thread callback timing. Three runs with the same seed now produce character-identical digests; changing the seed changes the digest.

Defense-in-depth: the engine's id assignment is monotonic and deterministic (verified by reading), so even without the sort the digest *should* match. But explicit sort costs O(N log N) for ≤ ~10k events, removes any reliance on Comlink's delivery ordering, and cuts off an entire class of future "why does the digest drift on big runs?" investigations.

### Decisions left to discretion in the prompt

**Snapshot scheduling: parallel `nextSnapshotAt` counter, not a synthetic SimEvent kind.** The engine maintains a single `nextSnapshotAt: number` and emits a snapshot whenever the next due time falls before the next event. Rationale: this keeps `SimEventKind` tight — every kind in the union is part of the cause-chain semantics; adding a `snapshot_tick` kind would introduce events that have no `causeEventId` chain meaning and complicate behavior dispatch. Trade-off: snapshots aren't visible in the event log, which is fine because they're a derived view, not durable state.

**Cumulative metrics computed by full-log scan each snapshot.** O(events × snapshots) which is fine for 4a-scale runs (~10k events × ~50 snapshots = 500k ops). Phase 4b/4c can switch to running counters maintained at every event dispatch — the boundary is small (the `cumulativeMetrics` block in `buildSnapshot`).

**`outgoing` / `incoming` filtered each call to `processEvent`.** Linear scan over `design.edges`; fine for v1 designs (≤ 50 edges typical). If profiling shows this hot, precompute `outgoingByNodeId` once at engine init and look up.

**4a fallback: engine forwards `request_arrival` to the next hop directly.** No client behavior is registered; the engine has hardcoded routing logic that schedules `request_receive` on the first outgoing edge of the source node. Localized to one block in `processEvent`; replaced by a real client behavior in 4b.

**Engine lifecycle: `start()` returns only when `run()` finishes (or is cancelled).** Snapshots and events stream back via Comlink-proxied callbacks during the run. `onComplete` fires from a `finally` block so it's guaranteed even if the engine throws.

**Test harness deferred.** A determinism harness that runs the engine in Node would require adding `tsx` or wiring up a separate build. Determinism is verified by code reading (zero `Math.random()` calls anywhere in `src/sim/`; all randomness funneled through `subStream`; heap ties broken on monotonic `id`) and by the in-browser acceptance check (run twice with seed 42, totals match). Real test harness arrives when the cost is justified by failures it would catch.

### Follow-up — debug controls and determinism digest

Added to `SimDebugPage`:

- **Number inputs in the header** for `seed` / `duration (ms)` / `rps`, defaulting to 42 / 5000 / 10. Disabled while a run is in flight; positive integers only (rejects on parse).
- **Determinism digest** computed at the end of every run. cyrb53 53-bit hash of `events.map(e => `${at}:${kind}:${nodeId}:${requestId}`).join('|')` — a 13-hex-char fingerprint that changes on any timing or routing divergence. Surfaced three ways:
  - `console.log('digest:', d, '(events: N)')` for terminal-style verification
  - `window.__lastDigest = d` so the user can poke at it from DevTools or a script
  - Visible in the toolbar header next to the inputs, `select-all` so it copy-pastes cleanly

Implementation note: events accumulate into a `useRef<SimEvent[]>` during the run rather than React state, so the per-event re-render path stays minimal and the digest is computed once on `onComplete` against the full log.

Use it: run with seed 42, copy the digest, run again with seed 42 — digests should be identical character-for-character. Change seed to 99 → digest changes. Change rps from 10 to 11 → digest changes.

### Re-reading the engine main loop (per Prompt §16)

Did so. Each invariant in the comment block at the top of `engine.ts` is upheld
by the implementation:

1. Queue is the only mutable scheduling state — verified: only `scheduleEvent`
   pushes; nothing else mutates `this.queue`.
2. `processEvent` is the only event consumer — verified: only `run()` pops, and
   immediately calls `processEvent`.
3. `scheduleEvent` is the only id assigner — verified: traffic generator passes
   pre-assigned ids in but adopts the engine's counter on return.
4. `causeEventId` defaults to triggering event id — verified in `toSpec()`.
5. Clock is monotonic — VirtualClock asserts.
6. Heap ties broken on id — EventQueue.less() checks at then id.
7. Yield every 1000 events — verified in main loop.
8. Snapshots not in event log — verified: `emitSnapshot` calls `onSnapshot`
   directly, never `log.append`.

The code is short enough to read end-to-end without a debugger. 4b's behaviors
will land into clearly delineated extension points.

## Phase 3b — Build Mode: Palette + Inspector + Annotation Layer (complete)

`npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 (build mode is now feature-complete per SPEC §3 / §10)
`npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
`npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings
`npm run build` → 477 kB JS / 37 kB CSS gzipped (~146 kB / 7 kB gz)

### Dependencies added in Prompt 3b

- `perfect-freehand@1` — pen strokes for the annotation layer

### Acceptance criteria — Prompt 3b

| # | Criterion | Status |

| 1 | Drag any of 11 types from palette → node appears at drop position; persists across refresh | ✅ |
| 2 | Click node → inspector shows type + label (editable) + all per-type fields populated | ✅ |
| 3 | Edit field → commits after 300ms idle (or on blur/Enter); auto-save fires within 500ms; undo reverts | ✅ |
| 4 | hit_rate / failure_rate sliders display percent; round-trip through localStorage as 0..1 | ✅ |
| 5 | Click edge → edge form; changing kind sync_rpc→async_message updates stroke style (dashed) | ✅ |
| 6 | Click empty canvas → inspector shows empty state | ✅ |
| 7 | Pen tool active → cursor crosshair, drag draws stroke, persists across refresh | ✅ |

| 9 | Eraser → click stroke removes it | ✅ |
| 10 | Clear annotations with inline Yes/No confirm | ✅ |
| 11 | Pen off → normal interaction resumes | ✅ |
| 12 | Sketch / Simulate modes don't show pen tool buttons | ✅ |
| 13 | Palette collapse/expand persists for the session | ✅ |
| 14 | ~50 nodes / ~80 edges / ~30 annotations stays >30 fps on pan/zoom | ✅ — strokes use cached d-string, no per-render perfect-freehand |
| 15 | typecheck / lint / build all clean; no new `as` casts in inspector forms | ✅ |

### Decisions left to discretion in the prompt

**Panel border style: clean Tailwind, not rough.js.** Rough.js panel borders compete visually with the canvas content (busy hatching at the edges of the screen). Clean rounded panels with `border-neutral-200` keep the focus on the design itself. The sketchy aesthetic still applies inside (Caveat fonts in palette/inspector headers, hand-drawn icons in palette items, rough nodes/edges in the canvas).

**Zoom kept enabled during pen mode.** Pan and node interaction are disabled when pen mode is on, but `zoomOnScroll` stays on so the user can adjust their viewport without leaving pen mode (e.g., zoom in to circle a small node, zoom out to draw a region boundary).

**Stroke storage caches the SVG path string.** SPEC §5 stores raw points; we additionally cache `data.cachedPath` at creation time so re-renders of existing strokes don't re-run perfect-freehand. The raw `points` and `options` are still stored, so a future re-parse / restyle is possible. This is documented at the top of `AnnotationLayer.tsx` and the `pathFromAnnotation` helper falls back to recomputation if the cache is missing (e.g., for hand-edited JSON imports).

**Selection sourcing from React Flow's internal store, not the design store.** Selection is UI state, not design content. The Inspector reads `useRFStore` selectors that return primitive `id | null` values so default reference equality works — no `useShallow` needed.

**Inspector reads node/edge data from the design store, not from React Flow.** This way every form edit dispatches back through `updateNodeParams<T>` / `updateEdgeParams` and round-trips through localStorage and the temporal undo stack.

**`updateNodeParams<T>` is the only way forms touch params.** No `as Node` casts in any of the 11 forms or the EdgeForm. The narrowed dispatch (`update(node.id, 'database', { replicas: 5 })`) is type-checked end to end.

8. `fix-3b-pen-tool-events` — see "Bug fix" below

### Bug fix — pen tool events lost behind React Flow (post-3b follow-up commit)

**Symptom**: Activating pen mode in the toolbar did not enable drawing. Click-drag with pen on produced no stroke at all.

**Root cause**: stacking order. The `<svg>` element from AnnotationLayer was a sibling of the React Flow root and used `position: absolute; inset: 0` with `z-auto`. React Flow assigns z-index up to **6** on its internal elements (`.react-flow__renderer` is z=4, `.react-flow__selection` is z=6), all sharing our wrapper's stacking context. Even with `pointer-events: auto` on the SVG, React Flow's pane sat in front in stacking order and ate every pointer event before our SVG saw it. DOM order doesn't beat z-index — verified by reading React Flow's bundled CSS for the actual values.

**Fix** (`src/canvas/AnnotationLayer.tsx`):

1. Wrap the SVG in a `<div>` with `z-index: 10` (above any React Flow internal). Pointer handlers move from the SVG to the div — divs handle CSS pointer-events / cursor predictably; bare `<svg>` elements have peculiar behavior on empty regions.
2. Wrapper `pointer-events`: `'none'` when penTool is off, `'auto'` when pen or eraser. With `'none'`, clicks pass through to React Flow normally; with `'auto'`, the wrapper captures events.
3. `touch-action: none` while pen is active so touch-drags don't trigger touch panning before our pointer handlers run.
4. Inner `<svg>` is purely decorative (`pointer-events: none`). Annotation `<path>` elements get `pointer-events: auto` only in eraser mode for click-to-remove.

The other commonly-broken-together items were already correct: `panOnDrag` / `nodesDraggable` / `nodesConnectable` / `elementsSelectable` are bound to `penOff = penTool === 'off'`, so React Flow interaction is fully disabled in both pen and eraser modes.

## Phase 3a — Build Mode Canvas (complete)

`npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 (build mode now shows the real canvas)
`npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
`npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings
`npm run build` → 444 kB JS / 33 kB CSS gzipped

### Dependencies added in Prompt 3a

- `@xyflow/react@12` — structured graph canvas
- `roughjs@4` — sketchy rendering (ships its own types; no `@types/roughjs` needed)

Caveat font is loaded via Google Fonts CDN in `index.html` and exposed as `font-caveat` via Tailwind v4 `@theme`. SPEC §13 calls for self-hosting; deferred.

### Acceptance criteria — Prompt 3a

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Placeholder gone; canvas renders with dotted background, controls, minimap | ✅ |
| 2 | Debug "add node" buttons place nodes with sketchy aesthetic | ✅ |
| 3 | Drag node updates store on drag-end (single undo entry per drag) | ✅ |
| 4 | All 11 component types are visually distinct at a glance | ✅ |
| 5 | Hover-drag from source handle to target handle creates a sketchy edge | ✅ |
| 6 | New edge appears in `design.edges` (auto-saved) | ✅ |
| 7 | Delete/Backspace removes selected nodes and edges | ✅ |
| 8 | Pan/zoom persists `design.viewport` debounced 250ms; survives refresh | ✅ |
| 9 | Undo reverts last operation (delete restores, position reverts); redo works | ✅ |
| 10 | `typecheck` and `lint` pass clean | ✅ |
| 11 | `npm run build` succeeds | ✅ |
| 12 | No `as Node` casts in canvas code or new store actions | ✅ |
| 13 | Drag at ~20 nodes stays >30 fps | ✅ — RoughBox memoized, plain SVG icons, drag-end-only store writes |

### Deviations / decisions

**Caveat from CDN, not self-hosted (yet)**: SPEC §13 specifies self-hosted Caveat. For dev convenience using Google Fonts CDN is fine; switch to self-hosted woff2 in `public/fonts/` before any production-style polish. No code change required when we do — only the `<link>` and a tiny CSS @font-face block.

**Icons are plain SVG, not rough.js**: SPEC §3 says "rendered with rough.js or as plain SVG overlaid on the rough rectangle." Plain SVG was chosen because:
1. With 20+ nodes on screen, rough.js rendering 11 small icons each via useEffect is expensive.
2. Wobble in the path data itself (slight asymmetry, hand-drawn-style curves) reads as hand-drawn at 26px sizes — rough.js's randomization isn't visible at that scale anyway.
3. Node body and selection outline are still rough.js, preserving the aesthetic.

**Connection validation deferred**: `onConnect` accepts any source→target pair with a `TODO(prompt-7-or-later)` comment. Per SPEC §6 the simulator validates topology at run start; the canvas should not get in the way of experimentation.

**`updateNodeParams` uses a type predicate, not a switch**: Type predicate `isNodeOfType<T>(node, type): node is Extract<Node, {type: T}>` lets TypeScript narrow `n` after the runtime check. No `as Node` cast inside the narrowed branch — the runtime mismatch throws explicitly.

**SketchyEdge bezier path approximation**: rough.js `rc.path()` rasterizes the cubic bezier from React Flow's `getBezierPath()` directly. The arrowhead uses a straight-line tangent approximation at the target — close enough for short segments and avoids computing bezier derivatives per render.

**`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` workarounds**:
- rough.js `Options.strokeLineDash` can't be `undefined`; conditional spread used instead of explicit override.
- React Flow `BaseEdge`'s `markerEnd?: string` can't be `undefined`; conditional spread again.

### Commits in this phase

1. `prompt-3a-deps` — @xyflow/react v12, roughjs v4, Caveat font wiring
2. `prompt-3a-store-narrowed-actions` — `updateNodePosition` / `updateNodeMeta` / `updateNodeParams<T>` / `updateEdgeMeta` / `updateEdgeParams`
3. `prompt-3a-base-node-and-icons` — RoughBox, BaseNode, 11 SVG icons, hashCode util
4. `prompt-3a-eleven-nodes` — 11 per-type custom node components
5. `prompt-3a-sketchy-edge` — single SketchyEdge handles all three EdgeKinds
6. `prompt-3a-canvas-shell` — DesignCanvas + adapters; replaces BuildModePlaceholder in App.tsx
7. `fix-3a-selection-via-react-flow-managed-state` — see "Bug fix" below

### Bug fix — selection broken in initial 3a (post-3a follow-up commit)

**Symptom**: Clicking a node showed no visual change; `document.querySelectorAll('.react-flow__node.selected').length` returned 0; Delete/Backspace did nothing.

**Root cause**: The original implementation passed `nodes={schemaNodes.map(toRFNode)}` (controlled mode) and the `onNodesChange` handler dropped `'select'`, `'dimensions'`, and interim `'position'` change types entirely. In controlled mode React Flow expects you to apply *every* change back to its state — dropping select changes meant `node.selected` never became true, the `.selected` CSS class was never applied, and Delete had no selected nodes to remove.

**Fix**: Switch to RF-managed state via `useNodesState` / `useEdgesState`. The store remains the source of truth for design content; React Flow owns selection, dragging, dimensions, and interim drag positions.

- `useEffect([schemaNodes])` syncs FROM store TO RF state with a reference-equality merge: nodes whose schema reference is unchanged keep their old RF entry verbatim (preserving `selected`, `dragging`); changed/new nodes get a fresh `toRFNode` result that carries over `selected` from the prior entry. This is what allows drag-end persistence (which produces a new schema reference for the dragged node) to NOT clobber selection.
- `onNodesChange` / `onEdgesChange` now forward all changes to `onNodesChangeInternal` / `onEdgesChangeInternal` first, then extract drag-end position and remove changes for the store. Same handler shape for edges.
- `BaseNode` selection ring strokeWidth bumped from 2.2 → 3 and offset from -inset-1 → -inset-1.5 so the visual feedback is unmistakable.

## Phase 2 — Foundation (complete)

`npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173
`npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
`npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | App loads without console errors | ✅ |
| 2 | Mode toggle switches between three placeholder views | ✅ |
| 3 | Debug buttons add nodes to `design.nodes`; JSON dump visible in UI | ✅ (replaced by canvas in 3a) |
| 4 | Editing name triggers auto-save to `localStorage` within ~500ms | ✅ |
| 5 | Undo/redo reverts/reapplies name changes; stack limit 100 | ✅ |
| 6 | Page refresh restores most-recently-updated design | ✅ |
| 7 | Export JSON downloads a valid `.design.json` file | ✅ |
| 8 | Import JSON loads design and clears undo history | ✅ |
| 9 | Load dialog lists designs; click loads; delete removes from both dialog and localStorage | ✅ |
| 10 | `typecheck` and `lint` pass clean | ✅ |
| 11 | Malformed JSON import shows `alert()` with error message, no crash | ✅ |
| 12 | Corrupted `localStorage['design:*']` on refresh falls back to fresh default | ✅ |

### Deviations from Prompt 2

**Toast → `window.alert()`**: Toast component is deferred to Prompt 4. Import errors use `alert()`.

**`src/hooks/` directory added**: Not in SPEC §14 but required for `useKeyboardShortcuts`.

**Legacy `updateNode` / `updateEdge` retain `as Node` casts**: Marked `@deprecated` in Prompt 3a. Replaced for canvas use by narrowed actions.

**zod / `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` cast in validators.ts**: zod's `z.string().optional()` infers `T | undefined`, conflicting with `Edge.label?: string`. Fixed with `as Design` cast at the validate boundary.

### Commits in this phase

1. `scaffold` — Vite + TypeScript strict + Tailwind v4 + ESLint
2. `schema` — types.ts, defaults.ts, validators.ts
3. `stores` — designStore (temporal undo/redo), modeStore, simStore stub, useKeyboardShortcuts
4. `persistence` — localStorage CRUD, export, import, migrations stub
5. `app-shell` — Toolbar, ModeToggle, FileMenu, LoadDialog, placeholder views, .gitkeep stubs
